deploy main contract using deploy.justit will return proxy address not the implementation, now
go to the owners wallet address and get the contract address forn the contract creation transaction and 
verify it in hardhat and it will get connected to the proxy.
now to upgrade create a new script like deployv2.js and add the proxy address there and again then deploy that file 
and then go to owner address in ether scan and get the contract address and verify it it will automatically connected to the 
proxy.
main commands
 npx hardhat verify --network rinkeby 0x6fd0e3563a94bc21651b094c3a2d64c818b1df93
 npx hardhat run scripts/deployv2.js --network rinkeby
